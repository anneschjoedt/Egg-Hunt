              Welcome to EggHunt. We publish real-world augmented reality mobile experiences, including mobile game applications ("Apps"), and operate a real-world augmented reality platform (“Platform”). Please read these EggHunt Terms of Service and any applicable App guidelines (the “Guidelines” and, collectively, “the Terms”), because the Terms govern your use of the Apps and Platform. The Terms also govern your interaction with any websites we own or operate (“Sites”), purchase of any EggHunt merchandise, participation in EggHunt live events or promotions (“Events”), and more generally your use of any EggHunt products or services (together with Apps and Platform, the “Services”).
              
              Some exceptions to the Terms may apply based on your country of residence - please see the country-specific sections below.
              
              If you live in the United States, these Terms are entered into between you and EggHunt, Inc., 1 Ferry Building Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111. If you live in any other country, these Terms are entered into between you and EggHunt International Limited, a company registered to do business under the laws of the United Kingdom. EggHunt, Inc. and EggHunt International Limited are collectively referred to as "EggHunt" or “we” in these Terms.
              
              By using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services. EggHunt may modify these Terms at any time, and if we do, we will notify you by posting the modified Terms on the Site or in the App. It’s important that you review any modified Terms before you continue using the Services. If you continue to use the Services, you are bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services.
              
              SECTION 13 "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. If you are a user in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or any other country that does not allow such arbitration agreement, Section 13 does not apply to you.
              
              If you breach these Terms we may take action against you, including but not limited to terminating your account. You acknowledge that EggHunt has no obligation to, and will not, reimburse or refund you for Services lost due to involuntary suspension or termination of your account.

              3.1 Cheating
            </h3>
            <h3>
              EggHunt prohibits cheating, and we constantly take steps to improve our anti-cheat measures. Cheating includes any action that attempts to or actually alters or interferes with the normal behavior or rules of a Service. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, any of the following behavior, on your own behalf or on behalf of others:
              
              Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software);
              
              Playing with multiple accounts for the same Service;
              
              Sharing accounts;
              
              Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing); and/or
              
              Selling or trading accounts.
              
              Apps may not work on devices that EggHunt detects or reasonably suspects to be cheating, and EggHunt will not provide support to players who attempt to cheat. You agree that EggHunt may employ any lawful mechanisms to detect and respond to cheating, fraud, and other behavior prohibited under these Terms, including checking your device for the existence of exploits or hacking and/or unauthorized software. Please see the Guidelines and our Privacy Policy for more information.
